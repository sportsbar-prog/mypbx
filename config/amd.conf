; Wait the FULL analysis time before deciding due to silence
initial_silence = 3000          ; Must be >= total_analysis_time to disable early HUMAN_SILENCE

; Keep total analysis time short but sufficient
total_analysis_time = 2500

; Greeting detection (for machines that say "Hello...")
greeting = 1200
after_greeting_silence = 600

; Word characteristics (to catch machine-like speech)
minimum_word_length = 100
maximum_word_length = 600
between_words_silence = 120
maximum_number_of_words = 2

; Silence sensitivity: higher = less sensitive (1500 is reasonable)
silence_threshold = 2000

; Conservative mode: if unsure → HUMAN (but only after full analysis)
amd_mode = conservative
